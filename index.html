            <p>Hey there! I am Akmol Hasan Chowdhury. I am a student of programming hero batch 4. I like to build
                websites.
                I tried but couldn't understand Java. Now in 2024 I am restarting my journey. So please keep me in your

                <p>I had started my journey to become web developer on July 2021. But because of less attention I
                    coudn't
                    become
                    a web developer. Now its 2024 I have started my journey again. I will become a junior web developer
                    in
                    2024
                    inshaallah.</p>

                <p>I think I am a baby developer. Bcz I dont know anything about coding except a little bit HTML and
                    CSS.
                    Now
                    once I have started my journey to become a pro web developer, I won't step back. I will complete it,
                    I
                    will
                    show my family that I can become a pro in web development.</p>
